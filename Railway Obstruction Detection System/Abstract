The aim of the project is to implement an obstacle detection system and alerting the driver of the vehicle using different sensors and IOT. 
Our objective is to implement ultrasonic sensors which will be mounted on the railway track when the obstacle comes in between an alert is provided to the driver
and concerned authority. A computer interface is enabled to the driver so that the collision can be avoided with accurate measurement of the obstacle distance. 
The problem statement has several geographical difficulties and many more in the implementation of the project. 
The main aim of the project is the smooth running of the railways with proper obstacle detection in a smart manner. 
The main objective of the project is to develop a device which basically detects the obstacle and tries to alert the driver to avoid major rail accidents. 
The data is then processed by the Arduino system in order to generate an alert. The sensors which is being used in the implementation of the project usually 
identifies the obstacle around the railway track. The data is processed by the main system in order to provide proper support. 
In the graphical user interface if the obstacle comes in the range an alert will be provided to the driver. 
The ultrasonic sensor usually works in the range of 2cm to 400cm. This paper broadly discuss the obstacle detection using sensors and IOT. 
This project measures the distance of the obstacle using the ultrasonic sensor which usually detects the obstacle and then Arduino processes the data and an alert is
being generated to driver in order to avoid the possible accidents.
